# Nonlinear-Distortion-in-OFDM
Analysis of nonlinear distortion due to a power amplifier in OFDM. 

Main functionalities are OFDM transmitter and receiver, with possibility of over-sampling.

The main parameter file is system.py, where LTE system bandwidth from 1.4MHz up to 20MHz, and modulations from BPSK to 64QAM are implemented.
